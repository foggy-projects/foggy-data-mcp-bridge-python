"""Error-code constants for Compose Query SQL compilation (M6).

r3 shape: **4 codes + 1 NAMESPACE constant** = 5 module-level constants.
Tests should assert ``NAMESPACE`` separately from the 4 full code
strings — see M6 execution prompt §错误码表 and §验收硬门槛 #3.

Phase labels (used by :class:`ComposeCompileError.phase`):
  - ``"plan-lower"`` — structural validation before SQL generation
  - ``"compile"`` — SQL generation through v1.3 ``_build_query``

These error codes intentionally do NOT overlap with
``compose-sandbox-violation/*`` (M3), ``compose-schema-error/*`` (M4),
or ``compose-authority-resolve/*`` (M1/M5). Errors from those phases are
propagated untouched by M6 — see spec §错误模型规划.
